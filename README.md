# HexagonPuzzleSolver

I made this project after I lost my mind with Hexagon puzzle found at student room Gurula. So I made a program which will solve it! I wanted to learn a new programming language, so I chose Python.

To run, type this when in /src:
```
python HexagonPuzzleSolver.py
```

To print all tested boards, add `-v` or `--verbose`, and in order to get all possible solutions, add `-a` or `--findAll`.

You can also modify the default pieces and board. Board doesn't have to be a big hexagon: it can be any shape.

Yes, I know it's slow. It uses brute-force. C'mon.
